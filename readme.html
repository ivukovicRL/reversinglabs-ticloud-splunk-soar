<h3>ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud File Reputation</h3>
This app implements the investigative action 'file reputation' on the ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud file reputation service. Information includes ReversingLabs Malware Presence information and Anti-Virus scanner information.<br><br>

The ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud File Reputation, part of ReversingLabs Threat Intelligence  provides up-to-date file reputation, Anti-Virus scan information and internal analysis information on billions of goodware and malware samples.<br><br>

Malware samples are continually reanalyzed to ensure that the reputation information is relevant at all times.<br><br>

In addition to file reputation and historical AV reputation, additional Threat Intelligence can be obtained from TitaniumCloud via multiple APIs and Feeds, which allow users to search for files by hash or anti-virus detection name. It is also possible to hunt for files from a single malware family, search for functionally similar samples, perform bulk queries, and receive alerts on file reputation changes.
